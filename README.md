## What is Back To The Future Trivia?

The title is fairly self-explanatory: create a trivia game consisting of 20 multiple choice questions of varying difficulty from all three films in the Back to the Future trilogy. I'm choosing to make it because I am a massive movie geek, I love these films, and since my GA WDI cohort is called 'DeLorean,' I wanted to pay tribute by creating a game that combined my passion for film with this course.
